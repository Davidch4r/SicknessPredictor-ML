-- Run the Program --

    First, import the packages:
        - tensorflow
        - tkinter
        - sklearn

    To run the program, simply just run the runner.py python script in this file. 
    It will take up to 15 seconds for the Neural Network to train, but afterwards
    there will be a questionnaire of symptoms displayed on a window. At the end there
    will be a message box of the probability of having each disease.
